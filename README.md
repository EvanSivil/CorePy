# CorePytools package

CorePytools (CorePy) is a machine learning python package applied to data collected from geological samples of core. 
- The primary focus of CorePy is to classify high resolution X-ray fluoresence data into chemofacies 
- unsupervised and supervised clustering tools are applied
- CorePy establishes a folder structure for input and output data. Visualizations are used to validate clustering results.

# Installation
pip install corepytools

# Running Corepytools and CorePy 
```
1) fork the CorePy repo to your github account
2) make a local clone:
 - command line: `git clone https://github.com/Totilarson/CorePy.git` 
 - if it is necessary to delete the local clone us: 'rm -rf .git*'
3) Navigate to the local repo //CorePy/ and inspect folders 'CoreData' and 'CorePycodes'
4) In //CorePy/CorePycodes open 'settings.py' and 'PCAexample'
- 'settings.py' contains variables for all the Python scripts
 - "CoreOfStudy", "Depth_model", "Formation", and "RockClassification" should match values in Public_XRF.csv datafile
```
# Settings.py and PCAexample
```
1) Run Settings.py and PCAexample.py 
 - Running PCAexample.py will build additional output folders and run PCA-Kmeans.
 - Output files can be viewed and the results .csv includes additional columns of data
```

#CorePy_plotting.py 
```
1) provides additional elemenal plotting
 - elemental cross plots. Elements are selected from Run_settings['Elements_plotted']
 - elements plotted with respect to depth: Depth model selected by: Run_settings['Depth_model']
 - element box plots. majors and trace
 - pie chart of chemofacies abundance
 - Depth referenced chemostrat column output in a folder //CorePy/CoreOutput/CrossSection/
```
